# dictionary-youtube

A desktop application consisting of a dictionary (linked to an SQLite database) and a direct YouTube search engine. This application was created using Java.

In this video I am prompted with a choice between using the dictionary or accessing YouTube directly from the desktop application. First, I choose the dictionary. You will see random words being entered into the dictionary search box. If the word is found, a definition is returned to the user. If the word is not found, the application will return a "Word Not Found" message. 
The application does not need to be restarted to search for a new word. The user is prompted with a message asking whether or not they would like to search for a new word before exiting the program.

Of course, adding thousands of english words and their respective definitions to your source code would be time consuming and will also slow down the program. So my application directly accesses an SQLite database on my computer that consists of thousands of words and definitions.

The user is also able to search for their favorite singer or song on YouTube without having to open their browser. The program will do this for the user automatically. In this video, I searched YouTube for the band U2.
